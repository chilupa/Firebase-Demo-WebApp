# Firebase-Demo-WebApp
This application gives you a brief idea about Firebase. Basically, Its a web application taking inputs from user and storing those values in the real time database, Firebase. 

The model I chose as an example for this application is a **User Registration** page as shown below:

![Alt text](/images/userregistration.png?raw=true "User Registration Page")

This page takes two values as input from the User i.e., Name and Email. These values will be stored in the **Firebase**. Following picture shows the Firebase console that I've used through out my application.

We can even get the data from the Firebase and populate the data on our Web page. This is how I was able to add the data on my web page.
