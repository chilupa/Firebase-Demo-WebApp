# Firebase-Demo-WebApp
This application gives you a brief idea about Firebase. Basically, Its a web application taking inputs from user and storing those values in the real time database, Firebase. 

The model I chose as an example for this application is a **User Registration** page as shown below:

# Database Structure in Firebase
This page takes two values as input from the User i.e., Name and Email. These values will be stored in the **Firebase**. Following picture shows the Firebase console that I've used through out my application.

# Getting the data from Firebase
We can even get the data from the Firebase and populate the data on our Web page. This is how I was able to add the data on my web page.
